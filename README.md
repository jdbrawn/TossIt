# TossIt
Android app in progress to help students dispose of waste properly at the student union. I started this application at the Boston University Global App Initiative's Global Appathon 2017. It is my first time developing an Android app, so progress is slow, but I am hoping to finish it soon.

In our student union food court at Boston University, there are compost, waste, and recycle bins, and much confusion among the students of where everything goes.
 Then idea of this app is to be able to easily enter what you purchased for lunch, and have the app tell you which bins to dispose your waste in.
